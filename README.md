# Optical Pumping

"This experiment is quantum mechanics in action. When a sample of gaseous atoms is placed in a static
magnetic field, the electronic states undergo Zeeman splitting in addition to fine-structure and hyperfinestructure splittings. By applying polarized light at the proper frequency, we can induce transitions from
ground state levels to excited state energy levels. The atoms then decay to higher ground state levels until
we have “pumped” all of them into the same (highest) ground state energy level. At this point we can see
an increase in light passing through the sample because no more can be absorbed. However, when we apply
a radiofrequency signal of just the right energy to stimulate transitions to a lower level, we see a sudden
decrease in the radiation signal as the system is again pumped to the higher level. By determining the
frequency of the RF signal we gain information about the atomic energy levels."
